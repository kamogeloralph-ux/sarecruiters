# Towber

> Fast Roadside & Towing.

Towber is a React Native motorist app backed by an Express API and Supabase (Postgres + PostGIS). The repository includes an EAS-ready Expo app, a Railway-compatible API, and versioned Supabase migrations.

## 1. Supabase setup

1. The client can use a temporary anonymous Auth session; partners use invite-only email magic links. Add `towber://auth/callback` to **Authentication → URL Configuration → Additional Redirect URLs**. Enable **Anonymous Sign-Ins** under Authentication → Sign In / Providers only if guest access is wanted. The mobile app never receives the server service-role key. See [the test partner setup guide](docs/test-driver-auth.md).
2. Install the Supabase CLI, sign in, link the project, and apply migrations:

   ```bash
   npx supabase login
   npx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
   ```

   For a **fresh project**, run `npx supabase db push` after linking.

   **Existing linked Towber production project:** its migration history has already been reconciled and all versioned migrations through `20261002000002` are applied by the manually dispatched GitHub Actions workflow; dispatch-lifecycle migration `20261002000003` must be applied by dispatching that workflow (or `npx supabase db push`) before the new API endpoints are used. Do not rerun the Towber-specific baseline repair. For a different existing project, inspect its tables and migration history before applying or repairing anything. `migration repair` changes only Supabase's history table; it does not run SQL, so use it only after verifying the actual baseline state.

   The migrations create or extend the live-compatible `towing_companies`, `vehicles`, `rate_cards`, and `tow_requests` schema; PostGIS geography columns and indexes; owner/request read policies; the API-only nearby/fare RPCs; private driver-location broadcasts; driver verification metadata; app profiles and roles; breakdown-service request fields; driver job alerts; and a private Storage bucket. Review the migration history before applying it to an existing project.
3. The schema migration does not seed business data. Use existing verified fleet records in a linked project, or add approved companies, active vehicles, and rate cards before testing search. Do not mark unverified real companies as verified just to populate the map.

The live request columns include `user_id`, `selected_company_id`, `assigned_vehicle_id`, `pickup_location`, `dropoff_location`, `estimated_distance_km`, `estimated_price_min`, `estimated_price_max`, and `status`; the new migration adds `breakdown_type`. The backend uses this contract.

The client route requests foreground GPS permission on mount, centers the map on the resulting fix, and sends the pickup `{lat, lng}` with an authenticated `POST /api/requests`. The backend writes `public.tow_requests.pickup_location` as a PostGIS geography point (`POINT(longitude latitude)`). There is no `towing_requests` table in this project; mobile does not insert directly because authenticated clients do not have request-table INSERT permission or the service-role key.

## 2. Backend (Railway or local development)

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Set SUPABASE_URL and the server-only SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

Health check: `GET /health`. Nearby vehicle example:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:4000/api/vehicles/nearby?lat=-26.2041&lng=28.0473&distance_km=12'
```

For Railway, set the service root to `backend/`, use the start command `npm start`, and configure `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as Railway variables. Never put the service-role key in the mobile app or any `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variable.

**Places autocomplete and driving directions:** enable **Places API (New)** and **Routes API** in Google Cloud, create a separate server-side Maps key, and set it as `GOOGLE_MAPS_SERVER_API_KEY` in Railway. Restrict that key to those APIs (and to fixed server IPs if your hosting plan provides static egress). Do not reuse the Android/iOS Maps SDK keys or expose this key to the app. The API proxies authenticated, rate-limited requests to Places Autocomplete and Routes; without this Railway variable the app reports that search is not configured. Suggestions are biased toward the pickup, limited to South Africa, and accompanied by Google's attribution. A selected place is resolved and routed with traffic-aware driving distance/ETA; the route distance is used for the fare quote and its encoded road polyline is drawn on the map.

## 3. Mobile app and EAS cloud builds

```bash
cd mobile
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in the public API URL, Supabase URL/anon key, and local map key values
npx expo start
```

The existing app uses native Google Maps and device location. Store the two Google Maps SDK keys as restricted keys in Google Cloud and configure `GOOGLE_MAPS_ANDROID_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_MAPS_IOS_API_KEY` as **EAS build environment variables**. Restrict the Android key to `com.towber.motorist` and the EAS signing certificate SHA-1; restrict the iOS key to bundle ID `com.towber.motorist`. The app needs the Maps SDKs enabled in Google Cloud. The keys are client-side native configuration, not server secrets; never commit actual keys.

Set these app environment variables in the Expo project’s EAS environment:

```text
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<your-railway-service>.up.railway.app
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
GOOGLE_MAPS_ANDROID_API_KEY=<restricted-android-key>
GOOGLE_MAPS_IOS_API_KEY=<restricted-ios-key>
```

Connect the local project to an Expo account once, then build in Expo’s cloud:

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest login
npx eas-cli@latest init
npx eas-cli@latest build --platform android --profile development
```

Use `--profile preview` for an installable Android APK, or `--platform all --profile production` for store-ready binaries. The first EAS build requires an Expo account/project and configured environment variables. Native modules such as Maps require a development/preview/production build; Expo Go alone is not the final test binary.

> This workflow does not require Node.js or a native compiler to run on your phone. Edit on the phone in GitHub or a code editor; Railway runs the API and EAS builds the app in the cloud.

## 4. OTA updates

The app is configured for EAS Update with an automatic **fingerprint runtime version**, separate `development`, `preview`, and `production` channels, and matching EAS environments. Fingerprinting changes the runtime when native code/config changes, preventing an incompatible JavaScript bundle from being sent to that binary.

**A new OTA-enabled APK is required once.** The preview APK currently building from an older commit does not contain `expo-updates` or these channel settings and cannot receive EAS Updates. After this setup is merged, create and install a fresh `preview` APK. Later JavaScript/TypeScript and bundled-asset changes can be published without another APK. Changes to native modules, Expo plugins, permissions, app configuration, or the Expo SDK still require a new EAS build.

To publish from a phone, open the [EAS OTA Update workflow](https://github.com/Towber/Towber/actions/workflows/eas-update.yml), choose **Run workflow**, select `preview`, and enter a release message. Production publishing is limited to the `main` branch. The workflow uses the existing `EXPO_TOKEN` repository secret and the matching EAS environment; ensure `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and the client-side Maps keys are configured in both the EAS `preview` and `production` environments. Do not put server-only credentials in the app.

Release/preview builds check for updates when launched. They download a compatible update in the background and apply it after a restart; this is not guaranteed to finish in under 10 seconds or to replace code while the app is open. Force-close and reopen the app (up to twice) to test a published update. This repository configures the publisher but does not publish an update automatically on every Git push.

## 5. Driver location, verification, and fares

- Driver GPS uses `PATCH /api/vehicles/:id/location`. The API validates the user's Supabase JWT; the database accepts only the fleet owner or an actively assigned driver. A PostGIS trigger stores the latest fix, updates `vehicles.current_location`, and sends a minimal private Broadcast to each active `tow-request:<request-id>` topic. The motorist app subscribes only after request creation; it no longer joins a public fleet-wide channel.
- `mobile/src/driverLocation.ts` exposes foreground driver GPS streaming. Android requests a 1-second interval; operating systems may throttle updates, and background tracking is not enabled in this first implementation. Only authorized request participants can join a private topic. In Supabase Realtime settings, disable **Allow public access** so private-channel RLS is enforced.
- The `driver-verification-private` bucket is private, limits files to 10 MiB, and permits PDF/JPEG/PNG. `driver_verification_documents` stores PDP and vehicle licensing-disc metadata, expiry dates, and review status. Upload paths start with the submitting user's UUID. The mobile app has not yet added a document-picker/review screen.
- `tow_service_classes` maps vehicles to Light Tow, Heavy Duty, or Flatbed. `tow_fare_rates` supports company-specific, effective-dated ZAR call-out, per-kilometre, and minimum rates. No new tariff amounts are seeded. Until a class-specific tariff is configured, the fare RPC falls back to that company's existing ZAR `rate_cards`; if neither exists, that vehicle is not quoted. `POST /api/requests` recalculates the quote server-side and snapshots the ZAR components on the request. Once a destination is selected, the app uses the Google Routes driving distance for its fare estimate; before selection, the nearby-truck list uses the 10 km default.

## 6. Expo Router roles

> **Naming:** Towber now hosts several services, so the app UI says *TowberPro* (see `mobile/src/copy.ts`). Internal identifiers are unchanged on purpose: the `driver` value of `user_role`, the `/(main)/driver` route, `vehicle_driver_assignments`, and the `driver_*` DB/API names.

`mobile/app/_layout.tsx` restores a Supabase session, reads the caller's `user_profiles.role`, and redirects to `/(main)/client` or `/(main)/driver`. Partners sign in using an invited email magic link; uninvited email addresses cannot create accounts from the app. Clients can explicitly continue with an anonymous guest session when that provider is enabled. New Auth accounts receive the least-privileged `client` role. The role column is not writable by signed-in users; a trusted administrator must promote a driver, as shown in [the test partner setup guide](docs/test-driver-auth.md).

The client route provides Google Places autocomplete for South African destinations, renders a traffic-aware road route, and uses its routed distance for the ZAR quote. It keeps the service choices Flatbed, Jumpstart, and Lockout; the selection is sent with and stored on the request. The partner route (`/(main)/driver`) reads the active vehicle assignment, streams foreground location while Online, and subscribes to private Realtime alerts for requests assigned to that vehicle. The Go online / Go offline button currently controls this app's GPS stream; fleet-wide availability persistence is not yet implemented.

The dispatch loop is closed end to end. A request is created `pending` with a 75-second offer window (`tow_requests.expires_at`); the partner alert offers **Accept** and **Decline**, and an accepted job advances through `accepted → en_route → arrived → completed` via `POST /api/requests/:id/accept|decline`, `POST /api/requests/:id/status`, and `POST /api/requests/:id/cancel`. All transitions run through the `transition_tow_request()` state machine, which authorizes the actor and rejects stale/raced actions with 409s. On decline or timeout the request re-dispatches to the next-nearest truck that has not already seen it (up to 3 attempts, tracked in `tow_request_offers`) before resolving as `declined`/`expired`. A partial unique index enforces one active request per motorist; `GET /api/requests/active` and `GET /api/requests/:id` sweep stale offers on read, and the motorist sheet polls `GET /api/requests/:id` to show the live status timeline with a cancel action.

## 6b. Pricing, partner onboarding and approval

Towing is priced by distance; every other service is a flat fee, optionally multiplied by an after-hours rate.
Partners apply in the app (service tier, services offered, documents) and an admin approves them with
`admin_approve_partner_application()`. Jobs are only offered to partners who offer the requested service and
have a price for it. Full guide: [docs/partner-onboarding-and-pricing.md](docs/partner-onboarding-and-pricing.md).

## 7. Checks

```bash
cd mobile
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npx expo install --check
npx expo config --json
```

## 8. Current scope

The app contains role-gated client and partner routes, invite-only email magic-link authentication, an optional anonymous client path, the motorist map, nearby fleet cards, breakdown service selection, ZAR quote display, authenticated request submission, Google Places autocomplete, traffic-aware road routes, private live-location tracking, a foreground partner Online/Offline GPS toggle, and the full dispatch lifecycle: incoming-job alerts with accept/decline, 75-second offer expiry with re-dispatch to the next-nearest truck, driver job progression (en route, arrived, complete), motorist status polling with cancel, and one active request per motorist. Persisted fleet-wide availability, push notifications, verification-document upload/review UI, and driver background location remain future work. A fare quote is an estimate; the operator may confirm a different final price.
